# TrybeSmith
TrybeSmith was a project made for study purpose and it was my first time using TypeScript.
### In this project I:
- developed an RESTful API with TypeScript and a SQL database for a store;
- I developed all the layers of the application (Models, Service and Controllers) and, through this application, it will be possible to perform the basic operations that can be done in a given database: Creation, Reading, Update and Deletion;
- an authentication for the login was also developed with the help of JWT.

### The application endpoints
- endpoint for product registration;
- endpoint for the product listing;
- endpoint for user registration;
- endpoint to list all orders;
- endpoint for users to login;
- endpoint to register an order;
